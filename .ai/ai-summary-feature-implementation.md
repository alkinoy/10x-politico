# AI Summary Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented automatic AI-powered summary generation for newly created political statements using the OpenRouter service. The feature is controlled by an environment variable and seamlessly integrates with the existing statement creation flow.

---

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Environment Configuration ‚úÖ

**File: `src/env.d.ts`**
- Added `USE_AI_SUMMARY` environment variable (optional string)
- This variable controls whether AI summaries are generated for new statements

### 2. AI Summary Service Integration ‚úÖ

**File: `src/lib/services/statement-service.ts`**

Added three new private methods to the `StatementService` class:

#### `isAiSummaryEnabled()`
- Checks if `USE_AI_SUMMARY` environment variable is set to `"true"`
- Returns boolean indicating feature status

#### `generateAiSummary(statementText: string)`
- Uses OpenRouter service to generate concise summaries
- Model: `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (fast and cost-effective)
- Temperature: `0.3` (low for consistent, factual summaries)
- Max tokens: `150`
- Returns JSON-structured response with summary field
- Gracefully handles errors (logs but doesn't fail statement creation)
- Returns `null` if feature is disabled or generation fails

#### `appendSummaryToStatement(statementText: string, summary: string)`
- Appends AI summary to original statement text
- Format: `\n\n---\n\nüìù AI Summary: {summary}`
- Clear visual separator distinguishes summary from original statement

### 3. Modified Statement Creation ‚úÖ

**File: `src/lib/services/statement-service.ts` - `createStatement()` method**

Updated flow:
1. Verify politician exists (existing)
2. **NEW:** Generate AI summary if enabled
3. **NEW:** Append summary to statement text if generated
4. Insert statement with potentially enhanced text
5. Fetch and return complete statement (existing)

---

## How It Works

### When `USE_AI_SUMMARY=true`:

1. User creates a new statement via POST `/api/statements`
2. System validates the statement (existing logic)
3. System calls OpenRouter API to generate summary
4. AI analyzes the statement and returns concise 1-2 sentence summary
5. Summary is appended to statement text with clear separator
6. Enhanced statement is saved to database
7. Users see original statement + AI summary when viewing

### When `USE_AI_SUMMARY=false` or not set:

- Statements are created normally without AI summaries
- No API calls to OpenRouter
- Original behavior preserved

---

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable/disable AI summary generation
USE_AI_SUMMARY=true

# Required for OpenRouter service (already configured)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Optional: Site URL for API requests
SITE_URL=http://localhost:4321
```

### Toggle Feature:

```bash
# Enable AI summaries
USE_AI_SUMMARY=true

# Disable AI summaries
USE_AI_SUMMARY=false
```

---

## Example Output

### Original Statement:
```
"I believe we need to increase funding for renewable energy projects 
by 40% over the next five years to meet our climate goals."
```

### With AI Summary Enabled:
```
"I believe we need to increase funding for renewable energy projects 
by 40% over the next five years to meet our climate goals."

---

üìù AI Summary: The politician advocates for a 40% increase in renewable 
energy funding over five years to achieve climate objectives.
```

### Visual Separator:
- Three dashes (`---`) create a horizontal line
- üìù emoji provides visual indicator
- "AI Summary:" label clearly identifies AI-generated content
- Easy to distinguish from original statement

---

## Technical Details

### AI Configuration

**Model Selection:**
- **Model:** `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- **Reason:** Fast, cost-effective, excellent for summaries
- **Cost:** ~$0.00015 per statement (very low)

**Generation Parameters:**
- **Temperature:** `0.3` (low = consistent, factual)
- **Max Tokens:** `150` (enough for 1-2 sentences)
- **Response Format:** JSON schema with `summary` field
- **Strict Mode:** Enabled for reliable JSON structure

**System Prompt:**
```
"You are a political analyst. Create very concise, objective summaries 
of political statements. Keep summaries to 1-2 sentences maximum. 
Focus on the key message or claim."
```

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If AI summary generation fails, statement is created without summary
- Errors are logged to console for monitoring
- Users never see failed summary generation
- Original statement creation always succeeds

**Possible Failure Scenarios:**
- OpenRouter API unavailable
- API key invalid or rate limited
- Network connectivity issues
- Model returns invalid response
- JSON parsing fails

All scenarios handled gracefully without blocking statement creation.

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Enable the Feature

Add to `.env`:
```bash
USE_AI_SUMMARY=true
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
```

### 2. Create a Test Statement

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/statements \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "politician_id": "some-uuid",
    "statement_text": "We must invest more in education to build a better future.",
    "statement_timestamp": "2025-10-30T10:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### 3. Verify the Response

Check that the returned statement includes:
- Original statement text
- Separator (`---`)
- AI summary with üìù emoji

### 4. Disable and Test

Set `.env`:
```bash
USE_AI_SUMMARY=false
```

Create another statement and verify NO summary is added.

## Performance Considerations

### API Call Latency:
- OpenRouter API typically responds in 1-3 seconds
- Statement creation takes slightly longer when enabled
- Consider this for user experience

### Cost Optimization:
- Using `gpt-4o-mini` (cheapest effective model)
- ~$0.00015 per summary (150 tokens)
- 10,000 statements = ~$1.50
- Very cost-effective for the value provided

### Optimization Options:
1. **Async Processing:** Generate summaries after statement creation (future enhancement)
2. **Batch Processing:** Generate summaries in background jobs
3. **Caching:** Cache summaries for similar statements (advanced)

---

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling:
- Statement text sent to OpenRouter API (third-party)
- OpenRouter processes but doesn't store data permanently
- Review OpenRouter's privacy policy for your use case

### API Key Security:
- API key stored in environment variables (secure)
- Never exposed to client-side code
- Only accessible in server-side operations

### User Privacy:
- Users aware statements are public
- AI summary doesn't reveal additional private information
- Summary based only on provided statement text

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Async Generation:**
   - Create statement first, generate summary in background
   - Improves response time for users

2. **Summary Analytics:**
   - Track which summaries are most helpful
   - A/B test different summary styles

3. **Customizable Summaries:**
   - Allow admin to configure summary length
   - Different summary styles (bullet points, keywords, etc.)

4. **Multi-Language Support:**
   - Detect statement language
   - Generate summaries in same language

5. **Summary Editing:**
   - Allow admins to edit AI-generated summaries
   - Flag inaccurate summaries

6. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Include sentiment in summary
   - Tag statements by topic/sentiment

---

## Files Modified

1. **`src/env.d.ts`** - Added `USE_AI_SUMMARY` type
2. **`src/lib/services/statement-service.ts`** - Added AI summary logic (3 new methods, modified 1 method)

## Files Used (No Changes):
- **`src/lib/services/openrouter-service.ts`** - Used for AI generation
- **`src/pages/api/statements/index.ts`** - No changes needed (uses service)
