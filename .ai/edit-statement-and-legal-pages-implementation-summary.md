     - Network errors
     - Validation errors
   - Success redirect to politician page

#### Component Reuse
The implementation maximally reuses existing components:
- `PageHeader` - Form title and description
- `FormContainer` - Consistent form layout
- `DateTimePicker` - Date/time input (pre-filled)
- `StatementTextarea` - Text input with character counter (pre-filled)
- `FormActions` - Submit/cancel buttons

- `GracePeriodIndicator` - Shows remaining edit time
- `PartyBadge` - Party display in politician info

#### Key Features Implemented
✅ Pre-filled form with existing statement data  
✅ Grace period indicator at top of form  
✅ Real-time grace period monitoring (updates every 60s)  
✅ Read-only politician display (cannot be changed)  
✅ Editable statement text and timestamp  
✅ Form validation (same as new statement)  
✅ Change detection (no API call if no changes)  
✅ PATCH request with only changed fields  
✅ Ownership validation on page load  
✅ Grace period validation on page load  
✅ Grace period expiration handling during edit  
✅ Unsaved changes warning  
✅ Error handling for all scenarios  
✅ Success redirect after save

#### API Integration
- **Load Statement:** `GET /api/statements/:id` with Authorization header
- **Update Statement:** `PATCH /api/statements/:id` with body:
  ```typescript
  {
    statement_text?: string;
    statement_timestamp?: string;
  }
  ```
- Handles 401 (auth), 403 (permission), 404 (not found) error responses
- Preserves user's changes on network errors

#### User Experience
- Clear visual indication of grace period remaining

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Edit Statement Page (Steps 1-3)
1. ✅ Created Astro page with full authentication and authorization checks
2. ✅ Created `PoliticianDisplay` component for read-only politician info
3. ✅ Created `EditStatementForm` with all features

### Phase 2: Legal Pages (Steps 4-5)
4. ✅ Created Terms and Privacy pages with comprehensive content
5. ✅ Created Footer component and integrated into Layout

## Technical Details

### Edit Statement Form State Management
```typescript
interface EditStatementFormState {
  // Editable fields
  statementText: string;
  statementTimestamp: string;
  
  // UI state
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  submitError: string | null;
  
  // Validation
  errors: {
    statementText?: string;
    statementTimestamp?: string;
  };
  
  // Grace period
  gracePeriodExpired: boolean;
}
```

### Grace Period Monitoring
- Initial check on component mount
- setInterval updates every 60 seconds (60000ms)
- Calculates remaining time from `created_at` timestamp
- Automatically disables form when expired
- Shows warning message to user
- Prevents submission when expired

### Form Validation
Same validation rules as new statement:
- Statement text: 10-5000 characters (trimmed)
- Statement date: Cannot be in future
- All fields required
- Focus management on validation errors

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Page Load Errors:**
   - Not authenticated → Redirect to `/auth` with returnUrl
   - Statement not found → Show error with "Go Home" button
   - Not owner → Show error with "Go Home" button
   - Grace period expired → Show error with "View Statement" button

2. **Submit Errors:**
   - Grace period expired → Show error, disable form
   - Authentication error → Show error, allow retry
   - Network error → Show error, preserve changes
   - Validation error → Show field-level errors

## Code Quality

### Linting
- All files pass ESLint with no errors
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Consistent code formatting

### Best Practices
- Early returns for error conditions
- Guard clauses for validation
- Proper error boundaries
- Clean component separation
- Reusable component patterns
- Comprehensive comments
- Type safety with TypeScript

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Semantic HTML elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance
