---

## Reused Components

The politicians endpoints leverage existing utilities:

1. **Validation Utils** (`src/lib/utils/validation.ts`)
   - ✅ `isValidUUID()` - UUID validation

2. **Database Client** (`src/db/client.ts`)
   - ✅ `getSupabaseClient()` - Service role client

3. **Type Definitions** (`src/types.ts`)
   - ✅ `PoliticianDTO` - List response type
   - ✅ `PoliticianDetailDTO` - Detail response type
   - ✅ `PoliticiansQueryParams` - Query parameters
   - ✅ `PaginatedResponse<T>` - Response wrapper
   - ✅ `ErrorResponse` - Error format

4. **Party Service** (indirectly via database joins)
   - Party data is included in politician responses

## Integration with Other Endpoints

The politicians endpoints integrate with:

### Already Integrated
- ✅ `GET /api/politicians/:politician_id/statements` - Uses politician data
- ✅ `GET /api/parties` - Referenced in party_id filter

### Will Integrate (Future)
- ⏳ `GET /api/statements` - Will include politician info
- ⏳ `GET /api/statements/:id` - Will show politician details
- ⏳ `POST /api/statements` - Will validate politician_id

---

## Next Steps

### To Use These Endpoints

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Ensure database has data:**
   - The `politicians` table should have records
   - Each politician must reference a valid party
   - Run seed script if needed

3. **Test endpoints:**
   - Use the test commands above
   - Verify search functionality works
   - Check party data is included
   - Verify statement count is accurate

### Recommended Next Endpoints

Based on user stories and remaining MVP features:

1. **`GET /api/statements`** - Recent statements feed (US-001) ⭐
2. **`GET /api/statements/:id`** - Statement detail
3. **`POST /api/statements`** - Create statement (US-005)

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Read-only endpoints (GET only)
- ✅ Full-text search using `ilike` (good for small datasets)
- ✅ Pagination using LIMIT/OFFSET (works well for MVP)

### Not Implemented (Post-MVP)
- ❌ `POST /api/politicians` - Create politician (admin only)
- ❌ `PATCH /api/politicians/:id` - Update politician (admin only)
- ❌ Advanced search (fuzzy matching, multiple filters)
- ❌ Cursor-based pagination

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- ✅ HTTP caching (1-minute cache)
- ✅ Efficient database queries with joins
- ✅ Index usage (primary key, foreign keys)
- ✅ Pagination to limit result set size

### Possible Future Optimizations
- Full-text search indexes for better search performance
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- CDN caching for popular politicians
- GraphQL endpoint for flexible queries
- Redis caching for frequently accessed politicians

---

## API Compliance

✅ Follows REST API plan specifications  
✅ Uses DTOs from `src/types.ts`  
✅ Follows project structure guidelines  
✅ Implements all validation rules  
✅ Returns correct HTTP status codes  
✅ Provides detailed error messages
