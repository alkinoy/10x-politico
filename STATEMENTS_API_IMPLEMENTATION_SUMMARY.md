# Phase 1 Statements API Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 1 of the API implementation focused on core statement functionality. All endpoints have been successfully implemented following the API plan and coding standards.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/statements
**File**: `src/pages/api/statements/index.ts` (GET handler)

**Purpose**: Recent statements feed - main feed functionality for US-001

**Features**:
- ✅ Pagination support (page, limit with max 100)
- ✅ Optional politician filtering via `politician_id`
- ✅ Sorting by `created_at` or `statement_timestamp`
- ✅ Ascending/descending order
- ✅ Filters out soft-deleted statements
- ✅ Returns nested politician and party information
- ✅ Returns creator profile information
- ✅ Public endpoint (no authentication required)
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

**Query Parameters**:
- `page` (optional): Page number (default: 1, min: 1)
- `limit` (optional): Results per page (default: 50, max: 100)
- `politician_id` (optional): Filter by politician UUID
- `sort_by` (optional): 'created_at' | 'statement_timestamp' (default: 'created_at')
- `order` (optional): 'asc' | 'desc' (default: 'desc')

**Response**: `PaginatedResponse<StatementDTO>`

**Status Codes**:
- 200: Success
- 400: Invalid query parameters
- 500: Internal server error

---

### 2. GET /api/statements/:id
**File**: `src/pages/api/statements/[id].ts`

**Purpose**: Single statement detail view

**Features**:
- ✅ Retrieves single statement by UUID
- ✅ Returns nested politician and party information
- ✅ Returns creator profile information
- ✅ Calculates `can_edit` and `can_delete` permission flags
- ✅ Permission flags based on ownership and 15-minute grace period
- ✅ Public endpoint (permissions calculated if authenticated)
- ✅ Filters out soft-deleted statements
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

**Path Parameters**:
- `id`: Statement UUID (required)

**Headers** (optional):
- `Authorization`: Bearer token for permission calculation

**Response**: `SingleResponse<StatementDetailDTO>`

**Status Codes**:
- 200: Success
- 400: Invalid statement ID format
- 404: Statement not found
- 500: Internal server error

---

### 3. POST /api/statements
**File**: `src/pages/api/statements/index.ts` (POST handler)

**Purpose**: Create new statement - implements US-005 (Add Statement)

**Features**:
- ✅ Requires authentication
- ✅ Validates politician exists (404 if not found)
- ✅ Validates statement text (min 10 chars, max 5000 chars)
- ✅ Validates timestamp format and ensures not in future
- ✅ Automatically sets `created_by_user_id` from authenticated user
- ✅ Returns created statement with full details
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling

**Headers** (required):
- `Authorization`: Bearer <jwt_token>

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "politician_id": "uuid (required)",
  "statement_text": "string (required, min: 10, max: 5000)",
  "statement_timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp (required, not in future)"
}
```

**Response**: `SingleResponse<StatementDetailDTO>`

**Status Codes**:
- 201: Created successfully
- 400: Invalid request data
- 401: Authentication required
- 404: Politician not found
- 500: Internal server error

---

## Service Layer Enhancements

### StatementService (`src/lib/services/statement-service.ts`)

**New Methods**:

1. **`getAllStatements(queryParams, authenticatedUserId)`**
   - Retrieves paginated statements feed
   - Supports filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Joins with politicians, parties, and profiles
   - Filters out deleted statements

2. **`getStatementById(statementId, authenticatedUserId)`**
   - Retrieves single statement with full details
   - Calculates permission flags (can_edit, can_delete)
   - Joins with politicians, parties, and profiles
   - Returns null if not found or deleted

3. **`createStatement(command, authenticatedUserId)`**
   - Creates new statement in database
   - Verifies politician exists
   - Sets created_by_user_id from authenticated user
   - Returns created statement with full details

**Existing Methods** (from previous implementation):

4. **`getStatementsForPolitician(politicianId, queryParams, authenticatedUserId)`**
   - Retrieves statements for specific politician (timeline)
   - Supports time range filtering (7d, 30d, 365d, all)
   - Already implemented in politician statements endpoint

5. **`verifyPoliticianExists(politicianId)`**
   - Helper method to check if politician exists
   - Used by creation and timeline endpoints

6. **`calculatePermissions(statement, authenticatedUserId)` (private)**
   - Calculates can_edit and can_delete flags
   - Based on ownership and 15-minute grace period
   - Returns false for unauthenticated users

7. **`getTimeRangeFilter(timeRange)` (private)**
   - Converts time range string to Date object
   - Used for timeline filtering

## Validation & Business Logic

### Input Validation
- ✅ UUID format validation for all ID parameters
- ✅ Pagination bounds checking (page >= 1, limit <= 100)
- ✅ Enum validation for sort fields and orders
- ✅ Statement text length validation (10-5000 chars)
- ✅ Timestamp validation (valid ISO 8601, not in future)

### Business Rules Implemented
- ✅ Only non-deleted statements are returned
- ✅ Grace period enforcement (15 minutes for edit/delete)
- ✅ Ownership validation for permissions
- ✅ Politician existence check before statement creation
- ✅ Automatic created_by_user_id assignment from JWT

### Security
- ✅ JWT token validation via `getAuthenticatedUser()`
- ✅ Optional authentication for public endpoints
- ✅ Required authentication for statement creation
- ✅ Proper error messages without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Input sanitization via validation

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints implement consistent error handling:

**Error Response Format**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "details": { /* optional context */ }
  }
}
```

**Error Codes Used**:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Invalid input data
- `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED`: Missing or invalid JWT
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Server-side error

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

**GET /api/statements**:
- [ ] List all statements without parameters
- [ ] Filter by valid politician_id
- [ ] Filter by invalid politician_id (should validate)
- [ ] Paginate through results (page 1, 2, etc.)
- [ ] Test limit boundaries (1, 50, 100, 101)
- [ ] Sort by created_at and statement_timestamp
- [ ] Test ascending and descending order
- [ ] Verify deleted statements are excluded

**GET /api/statements/:id**:
- [ ] Retrieve existing statement (unauthenticated)
- [ ] Retrieve existing statement (authenticated as owner)
- [ ] Retrieve existing statement (authenticated as non-owner)
- [ ] Verify can_edit/can_delete flags for owner within grace period
- [ ] Verify can_edit/can_delete flags after grace period
- [ ] Try invalid UUID format
- [ ] Try non-existent UUID
- [ ] Try deleted statement ID

**POST /api/statements**:
- [ ] Create statement with valid data (authenticated)
- [ ] Try without authentication (should fail 401)
- [ ] Try with invalid politician_id (should fail 404)
- [ ] Try with statement text < 10 chars (should fail 400)
- [ ] Try with statement text > 5000 chars (should fail 400)
- [ ] Try with timestamp in future (should fail 400)
- [ ] Try with invalid timestamp format (should fail 400)
- [ ] Verify created statement has correct created_by_user_id
- [ ] Verify newly created statement has can_edit=true, can_delete=true

### Files Used (Unchanged)
- `src/types.ts` - All necessary types already defined

- `src/lib/utils/validation.ts` - Validation helpers
- `src/db/client.ts` - Supabase client
- `src/db/database.types.ts` - Database types

- `PATCH /api/profiles/me` - Update user profile
- `GET /api/profiles/:id` - Get public profile

### Phase 3 - Edit/Delete with Grace Period
- `PATCH /api/statements/:id` - Edit statements (with grace period validation)
- `DELETE /api/statements/:id` - Delete statements (soft delete with grace period)

### Phase 4 - Moderation
- `POST /api/statements/:statement_id/reports` - Report statements

---

## Compliance with API Plan

- ✅ Error responses follow standard format
- ✅ HTTP status codes as documented
- ✅ Business logic (grace period, permissions) implemented correctly
- ✅ Security requirements met (JWT auth, validation)
- ✅ Performance considerations (pagination, indexes via queries)

---

## Code Quality
